七年前，这个市场几乎不存在。

As our attention span is falling to seconds, short video is not only here to stay, but will become the new normal.

5
00:00:39,302 --> 00:00:50,789
与 Instagram 等其他社交平台不同的是，在这些平台上，完美剪辑、精雕细琢的图片是常态，而短视频则更容易让人接受，吸引着不完美和真实的人。
Unlike other social platforms such as Instagram, where perfectly edited, polished images are the norm, short videos are more accessible, inviting imperfection and authenticity.

6
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:57,898
由于每个片段的时间都很短，内容制作者必须具有创造性和简洁的沟通能力。
 And because each clip is so short, content producers have to be creative and concise communicators.

通过将展品与表情符号、音乐歌词或有趣的引语相搭配，博物馆使其艺术品更容易被年轻一代的艺术爱好者所接受，也更贴近他们的生活。
 By matching exhibits with emojis, music lyrics, or funny quotes, the museum is making its artwork more accessible and relevant to the young generation of art lovers.

冠状病毒
Coronavirus!

自 2020 年 4 月出现在 TikTok 上以来。
 since its appearance on TikTok in April 2020.

In 2018, Douyin, the leading Chinese short video platform, as part of its social responsibility initiative to alleviate poverty in China, launched a campaign to help individual farmers and small businesses in China's mountainous areas sell farm produce.

作为试点项目之一，豆瓣邀请内容生产者制作四段 15 秒的短视频，展示其产品的品质。
 As one of its pilot projects, Douyin invited content producers to create four pieces of 15-second short videos, showcasing the quality of their products.

27
00:04:21,057 --> 00:04:25,182
这是其他常规公关活动（如宣传文章）的补充。
This is on top of other regular PR initiatives such as promotional articles.

28
00:04:25,702 --> 00:04:41,346

 Many brands that are interested in hiring and recruiting young people have been using short video as a fresh way to engage with Generation Z. For example, more than half of McDonald's employees are aged between 16 to 24.

在澳大利亚，该品牌近年来一直在努力招募员工。
 In Australia, the brand was struggling to recruit in recent years.

32
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:31,797

So it launched something called Snaplication, which is a Snapchat lens that enabled users to shoot 10 second videos explaining why they'd be a perfect McDonald's employee and then prompt them to the link of job application.

 four times more than the number they received in the whole week using traditional methods.

目前还不清楚通过短视频招聘是否是找到合适人选或留住人才的最佳方式。
Well, it's unclear whether hiring over short video as the best way to find the right people for the job or to retain talent.

 and the company launched the campaign again later in the US.

就像我喜欢从短视频中获取育儿技巧一样，许多用户也希望利用这个平台来学习，不过是小剂量的学习。
Much like how I like to get parenting tips from short video, many users also want to leverage the platform to learn, but in tiny bite-sized doses.

While the app has been banned in the country since July 2020, it launched a huge demand for educational short video content, and other platforms are jumping in to fill in the space.

随着第一波短视频在该平台上广泛传播，受众受到了启发，有些人甚至开始制作自己的教育内容。
 As the first wave of short video became widely spread on the platform, audiences got inspired, and some even began to create their own educational content.

与所有社交媒体一样，人们对短视频平台的担忧也不无道理。
Like all social media, there are valid concerns around short video platforms.

49

包括数据隐私、格式的成瘾性以及内容缺乏细微差别和上下文。
 including data privacy, the addictive nature of the format, and the lack of nuance and context in the content.

It is precisely because of this that we need to find the right way to benefit from this young medium through collaboration among users, platforms, and policymakers.

53
